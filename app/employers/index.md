*Jan 2010 - till it ended*

EBR was the starting of my professional life in many perspective. Though I was the co-founder and served as a DJ and Developer the learning experiences on how to work in a team and how to be polite, how to control people were taught here. Sadly I cannot keep up with the stress of hosting a radio station anymore (Trust me its TOO much more work then you think !). Working there was an amazing expereince.

Tech Stack :

* HTML/JS
* PHP
* SAM Broadcaster & PAL Scripts

EBR will always be in my heart and soul !
