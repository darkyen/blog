                <p>I started programming very young at age of 13, thanks to the very awesome <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch Community</a>. I then tried C/C++ but found more interest in the web-stack with intense ranting and help from the <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/17/">StackOverflow JS Chat</a> I am now able to create what I wish with the stack. Recently I started exploring Machine Learning and building apps out of it.</p>
