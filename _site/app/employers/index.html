<p><em>Jan 2010 - till it ended</em></p>

<p>EBR was the starting of my professional life in many perspective. Though I was the co-founder and served as a DJ and Developer the learning experiences on how to work in a team and how to be polite, how to manage people were taught here. Sadly I cannot keep up with the stress of hosting a radio station anymore (Trust me its TOO much more work then you think !). Working there was an amazing expereince.</p>
